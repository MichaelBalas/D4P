# D4P Timed Tap Test
The Bradykinesia Akinesia Incoordination Test (BRAIN TEST) data is used to evaluate patients with Parkinsonism. The BRAIN TEST is a computerized alternating finger tapping test. 

Statistical analysis is performed to detect changes in the following variables after dance training:
1. Kinesia Score    (KS) - # of keystrokes/min
2. Akinesia Time    (AT) - Cumulative time that keys are depressed
3. Dysmetria Score  (DS) - A weighted score generated from incorrectly hit keys and corrected for speed
4. Arrhythmia Score (AS) - Variance of the time interval between individual keystrokes

Due to the small sample size (n=4) and limited time of dance training (one month), no statistically significant results were found.
